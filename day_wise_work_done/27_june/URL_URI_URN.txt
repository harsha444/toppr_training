URI: Superset of URL and URI. It contains the method(i.e defines how to access resource), location(where resource resides) and the resource itself(may be a image/text file)
URL: Method+Location."All Urls are URIs, but all URIs need not necessarily be URLs".
eg:http://google.com/author/betty.html#posts
here the part till .html is URL and the resource i.e posts doesn't come under the URL part, but is a URI
URN: Namespace. It basically contains the location of resource
